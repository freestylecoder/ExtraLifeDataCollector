# ExtraLifeDataCollector
This project creates a simple program to grab all the data for a user at http://www.extra-file.org

This project was created because I use an Elgato Game Capture HD.  The 3.5 version of the software allows you to update text blocks on the overlays from local text files in real time.  This program grabs all your data for the Extra Life website and places it in local text files.

To use this product, all you need to do is update a few values in the config file.

This is very much a work in progress and is submitted AS IS.  I do plan on adding to it.

If you like what you see, please either make a donation to my Extra Life page at http://www.extra-life.org/participant/cgardner or find someone supporting your local Childrens Miracle Network hospital and donate to them.
